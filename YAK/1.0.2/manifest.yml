  Replace the default help in the component right-click menu to a new Super Helper window in WPF.
  
  
  Super Helper window contains five tabs, namely Origin Help, URL Help, Params Help, Development Help and settings.
  
  
  Origin Help is the default help in Grasshopper. URL Help can specify a web page for every document object. Params Help can show document object's properties and data in calculation. Development Help can find the document object's assembly file, and its extra properties.
  
  
  1.0.2 Notes:
  
  1. Make Url Helper not auto-go when change the target. Plase click go when you need to go for website.
  
  2. If you already have urls.json file, please send it to Grasshopper Settings Folder.
